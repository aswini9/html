              <span class="card-title"> <h3 align="center"><b>Yoga increases your flexibility</b></h3> </span>
              <p>This is why many people start yoga, and it’s certainly a great benefit of yoga practice. Yoga postures and sequences help to increase the body’s range of motion. The mindful approach of yoga helps to ensure that stretching is done safely, allowing the nervous system to release the muscles into gentle, effective stretches. This reduces the risk of injuring ligaments and tendons, which can occur through more aggressive approaches to flexibility training. Releasing tension in the muscles can also help them to relax and let go, helping your body to open up more.</p>
         <span class="card-title"> <h3 align="center">   <b>Yoga helps you to build strength</b></h3></span>

<p>Although many people overlook this one, seeing only yoga’s benefits for flexibility, yoga is actually a fantastic strengthening practice.. Yoga helps to strengthen the muscles that support the body’s weight, leading to functional strength. It is also fantastic for building core strength. This improves athletic performance and your functionality in everyday life, while keeping you safe from injury.</p>
 <span class="card-title"> <h3 align="center">  <h3><b> Yoga improves your posture </h3></b></span>

<p>One of the great things about the strengthening and stretching work of yoga is that it is a balancing practice. Yoga can help to address any muscular imbalances, lengthening tight areas and strengthening weak areas. Our posture can often deteriorate as we age, in a large part due to our habitual movement patterns during the day. For instance if you spend a long time working at a computer, you may find yourself vulnerable to slumping with rounded shoulders. Over time the back muscles become weak, and the chest muscles become tight, exacerbating the rounded posture. Yoga can help you to stretch out the chest and strengthen the muscles of the back. It can also make you far more aware of your body and posture, so that you find yourself automatically self-correcting to come into a healthier alignment throughout the day.

<span class="card-title"> <h3 align="center"><b>Yoga helps to keep your joints healthy</h3></b></span>

<p>Yoga will strengthen the muscles around the joints, helping to stabilise them. By moving the joints in their full range of motion, yoga can help to promote better joint health. The mobilisation of the joints improves the flow of synovial fluid, which lubricates them, allowing for smooth and healthy movement of the bones. Synovial fluid also delivers fresh oxygen and nutrients to the joint cartilage, helping to restore it and keep it healthy. Yoga can even help those with more serious joint problems such as arthritis, improving physical function and reducing pain.1

Many people find that the acceptance and self-love that they practise on the yoga mat can have a profound impact to the way they treat their bodies off the mat, whether that is through improved activity levels. better nutritional choices or reduced reliance on alcohol or tobacco.

Controlled breathing can increase energy levels and relax the muscles, while reducing stress, anxiety and depression. On a physiological level, regular yoga practice has been found to improve lung capacity and breathing both in healthy adults and those who suffer from asthma. Yoga encourages your body’s natural healing process. 
The body has an incredible ability to heal itself, given the appropriate conditions.
